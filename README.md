# MK-Studio
The layout for Tangen Videreg√•ende Skole's TV-studio

The reason this project exists is so that others who follow my path won't have to do the research. The system as it is now is set for SD broadcasts in an interlaced format. The cameras should be able to output HD signals and I'm researching how to achieve that. To record the broadcasts as of 12. May 2017, you have to go through a DVD Player with recording function and write to a DVD from the internal HDD of the player. There are three computers, where one is VB (Video Tape), one is SUPER and one is for internet streaming (not accessable for student use). The SUPER mirrors the PROGRAM screen, but there's no audio signal to the computer, so unless you rearrange the cables for audio there will be a silent recording.
