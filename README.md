# MK-Studio
The layout for Tangen Videreg√•ende Skole's TV-studio

The reason this project exists is so that others who follow my path won't have to do the research. The system as it is now is set for SD broadcasts in an interlaced format. The cameras should be able to output HD signals and I'm researching how to achieve that. To record the broadcasts as of 12. May 2017, you have to go through a DVD Player with recording function and write to a DVD from the internal HDD of the player. There are three computers, where one is VB (Video Tape), one is SUPER and one is for internet streaming (not accessable for student use). The SUPER mirrors the PROGRAM screen, but there's no audio signal to the computer, so unless you rearrange the cables for audio there will be a silent recording on the SUPER.

# Camera Equipment
Contains a list of equipment ment for the cameras and is used in the studio.

Short about it, there are four cameras, but only three are used in "regular" broadcasts with the teacher present as they're on Dolly tripods. The fourth is a bit different and does not use the CCU cables, but a series of adaptors from RJ-45 to RS-422 to TIL and then into the camera controll port. It does not have an external VF, but relies on the stock option on the left-hand side. Not suited for moving around and should be left standing still for the whole broadcast.

# Control Equipment
Contains a list of equipment ment for the Control Room and is used to control the broadcast, videostreams and light.

# Spotlights and Lamps
Contains a list of lamps and lamp equipment to lighten the studio.
